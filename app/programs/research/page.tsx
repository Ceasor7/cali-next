          We conduct numerous studies to uncover trends, challenges and
          opportunities in the arts sector aiming to support policymakers,
          artists and stakeholders with accurate data. By highlighting the value
          and potential of creative and cultural activities, we strive to
          contribute to the sustainable growth and development of the arts
          community in Kenya. Our research not only sheds light on the current
          state of the creative arts economy but also paves the way for future
          innovations and advancements in the field.
